###### This project is created to complete the **Free Code Camp** task `Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Technical Documentation Page` 
### Project Concept
The idea of this project is to create a technical documentation page on a Theme. I chose here the theme of `ECMA6 Features`. The idea is,
describing popular features of `ECMA6`. There will be a sidebar containing link for each topic discussed. Clicking these links corresponding topic will come to the foreground. Ex: by clicking "let and const", the section with header "JavaScript let and const" will be opened.  
`technicalDocumentation.html` : This file contains the html specifications  
`main.css` : This file contains corresponding CSS declarartions
- The project follows HTML5 standards. Every `section` element is maintained with its corresponding `header`  
- All the coding parts are maintained in corresponding `code tag`
- CSS Grid is used in this project
- How to use `position:fixed` in Grid based project is shown here
- CSS `Media Query` is used to display content in smaller screen such as mobile phone
- CSS `box-sizing property` is used to to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.
