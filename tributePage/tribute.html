  <h3 style="text-align:center;font-family:lobster">A story of extra-ordinary passion and perseverance</h3>
  <div class="main">
  <p>She is an American author, Journalist, motivational speaker and long distanced swimmer. In September,2013 Diana created a history, showed an exemplary courage, passion, endurance by being the first person to swim from Cuba to Florida without a protective cage in nearly 53 hours. She was accompanied by 35 crew members including divers to watch for sharks. The swim was a long-awaited triumph for Nyad, who was making her fifth attempt since 1978 and her fourth since turning 60. So at 64 She made it clear if there is a will, there is a way. With this swim she broke Penny Palfrey's record for the farthest anyone has managed on the trek without a shark cage. In 1997, Australian Susie Maroney completed the swim from within a shark cage. She was 22 at the time.</p>
<p>The swim wasn't easy.At one point, she was vomiting because she had so much salt water in her system and was shivering. She sang lullabies to help her relax. The first four tries were marked by gut-wrenching setbacks; if the rough, strength-sapping seas didn't force her to quit, an hours-long asthma attack or paralyzing and excruciating jellyfish stings did. But for this swim, besides donning a suit meant to protect her against her jellyfish nemesis, she wore a special mask to prevent jellyfish stings to her tongue, a key factor in her failed attempt last year. Nyad, who was 29 when she first tried the swim, said last week that she wanted to show that "you can dream at any age." She nurtured her dream for 35 years and she tried time to time, failed but never gave up till she achieved it.</p>
